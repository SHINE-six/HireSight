HireSight is an artificial intelligence recruiting solution designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of talent acquisition. The platform starts by matching resumes, uses natural language processing technology to analyze the applicant's skills, experience, educational background, etc., and screens out qualified candidates based on these criteria. Next, the HR department will use the AI-generated content detector and plagiarism detector to further verify the candidate's resume content, and conduct interviews with candidates who pass the verification. The interview is divided into two rounds, the first round is an interview conducted by AI, and the last round is an interview with technical personnel. During the AI interview process, the system will analyze the interviewer's answers, including emotion recognition, body language analysis, and eye movement, to detect possible dishonesty. Finally, the system will generate a report based on all interview information to evaluate whether the candidate's abilities meet the job requirements and provide feedback for the candidate to improve.
